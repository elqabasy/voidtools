.SH SYNOPSIS
.B livedns

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B livedns
is a Bash-based utility that performs DNS lookups for a list of domains.  
It supports parallel resolution and can write results to a file.

It is intended for quickly checking if domains resolve, useful for reconnaissance, monitoring, or scripting in security and network administration.
