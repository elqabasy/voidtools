.SH NAME
clone \- Authorized site cloner and analyzer for lab use

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clone.sh
[\fIURL\fR] -o \fIOUTDIR\fR [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clone
is a professional site mirroring and discovery tool intended for
authorized testing in controlled lab environments.  
It supports stealthy crawling and downloading with randomized
headers, User-Agents, and request timing to simulate human-like browsing behavior.  

By default, stealth mode is enabled.  

The tool builds a URL list via a spider phase and downloads content in parallel or sequentially.  
It supports reporting, analysis, and multiple output formats.

.SH USAGE
The basic usage requires a target URL and an output directory:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh https://example.com -o clones
.RE

Advanced usage includes stealth configuration, UA rotation, parallel threads, and crawl depth:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh https://example.com -o clones --depth=3 --threads=5 --ua-list=my_uas.txt
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -o ", --output" \fIDIR\fR
Output directory for mirrored content (created if missing). Required.

.TP
.BR --no-stealth
Disable stealth mode. Requests will use default wget behavior.

.TP
.BR --ua-random
Enable random built-in User-Agent rotation. Default: enabled.

.TP
.BR --ua-list= \fIFILE\fR
Supply a custom list of User-Agent strings (one per line). Overrides built-in UA rotation.

.TP
.BR --depth= \fIN\fR
Recursion depth for crawling/spidering. Default: 1.

.TP
.BR --threads= \fIN\fR
Number of parallel downloads. Default: 1.

.TP
.BR --dry-run
Perform a trial run without downloading any files. Useful to verify settings.

.TP
.BR -q ", --quiet"
Suppress non-error output.

.TP
.BR -v ", --verbose"
Enable detailed debug and information output.

.TP
.BR -h ", --help"
Display this help message and exit.

.SH STEALTH FEATURES
By default, stealth mode includes:
.IP
- Random delays between requests (1â€“5 seconds).
- Randomized User-Agent per request.
- Randomized HTTP headers (Accept, Accept-Language, X-Requested-With).

Use \fB--no-stealth\fR to disable these features for standard wget behavior.

.SH OUTPUT & LOGGING
All outputs are organized under the specified \fIOUTDIR\fR:

.TP
\fIOUTDIR/\fR
Root output directory.

.TP
\fIOUTDIR/urls.txt\fR
Collected URLs from spider phase.

.TP
\fIOUTDIR/wget_spider.log\fR
Raw spider wget log.

.TP
\fIOUTDIR/wget_download.log\fR
Raw download wget log.

.TP
\fIOUTDIR/report.json\fR
JSON report containing metadata and URL list.

Additional formats supported:
.TP
- TXT, CSV, SQLite (via flags in the script).

.SH EXAMPLES
Sequential download with stealth:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh http://example.com -o clones
.RE

Parallel download, depth=3, custom UA list:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh http://example.com -o clones --threads=5 --depth=3 --ua-list=my_uas.txt
.RE

Dry-run to verify configuration:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh http://example.com -o clones --dry-run
.RE

Disable stealth for normal wget behavior:

.RS
$ ./clone.sh http://example.com -o clones --no-stealth
.RE

.SH NOTES
.B clone
respects robots.txt by default. Ignoring robots must be deliberate and is not recommended outside lab environments.

Use this tool only in authorized and controlled environments. It is not intended for use on production websites without explicit permission.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
No environment variables are required. Optional:
.TP
STEALTH
Global variable controlling stealth behavior (true/false).

.TP
UA_LIST
Array of custom User-Agent strings (overrides built-in list if provided).
